# DailyReadings
Daily-readings is a professional full-stack React application designed to bring the daily Catholic liturgy and historical saint hagiography to your fingertips. By integrating multiple global APIs, the app provides real-time scripture readings and automatically "generates" historical portraits of the Saint of the Day.
## 🚀 Features
### 📂 Daily Liturgical Dashboard
Automatically fetches today’s Mass readings (First Reading, Psalm, and Gospel) based on your specific timezone.
### 🖼️ Smart Saint Iconography
Uses the Wikipedia API to dynamically find and display high-quality historical art and biographies for the specific saint being celebrated each day.
### 🎨 Liturgical Color Sync
The UI accent colors and badges automatically update to match the current liturgical season (White for Easter/Feasts, Green for Ordinary Time, Red for Martyrs, etc.).
### 💾 Smart Caching
Includes LocalStorage integration to save data locally, ensuring fast load times and reduced API calls for repeat visits.
### 📱 Responsive Experience
A split-pane "Sticky" layout that works seamlessly across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
### 🌍 Timezone Awareness
Uses advanced date formatting to ensure users in different parts of the world always see the correct readings for their local sunrise.
